#Plugins# :- # git ,html publisher , pipeline steps , copy artefact.

Jenkinsfile : The text file where all the definitions of pipelines are defined is called Jenkinsfile. It is being checked in the source control repository.

Pipeline : Basically, a pipeline is a group of build jobs that are chained and integrated in sequence.

#Scripted# : In the above syntax, the node is a part of the Jenkins distributed mode architecture, where there are two types of node, Master which handle all the tasks in the development environment and the Agent is being used to handle multiple tasks individually.

Node {
           }

#Declarative Pipelines# : Declarative Pipelines are the newest additions to Jenkins that simplify the groovy syntax of Jenkins pipelines (top-level pipeline) with some exceptions, such as:

Syntax : pipeline {
                agent any
                stages {
stage(‘Build’) {
                steps {
// Statements…
                }
                }
       stage (‘Test’) {
       steps {
              // Statements…
       }
       }
    }
}

Pipeline: The block of script contents.
Agent: Defines where the pipeline will start running from.
Stage: The pipelines contain several steps enclosed in the block called Stage.
