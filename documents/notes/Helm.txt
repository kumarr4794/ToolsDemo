    - creates new charts
    - Packages charts into archive.
    - Installs & Uninstalls Charts.
    - Manages chart release cycle.


o TILLER SERVER o :
    - Interacts with Kubernetes API
    - Manages releases.
    - Listens for requests from helm chart.
    - Combines a chart and a config into a release.

- What is package manager? / dependency management.

Example , RHEL has yum , OSX - brew which creates graph of dependency packages needed to install your one package and installs them on your machine.

We need to know	what repos we are using to pull the packages,

Package management in K8s :

Commands :

Create chart : helm create <ChartName>

List charts : > helm ls / list

Search chart : helm search <chart-name> , use stable/<chart-name> or --version to install specific version

Install : helm install stable/wordpress , options --version to specific release.

Fetch : helm fetch stable/wordpress , Just pull the charts and keep it as local copy doesn't installs.Pass --untar to unzip the chart.tar

Delete : helm delete <release-name> / helm unistall releaseName

To Upgrade : helm upgrade <release-name> stable/

Dependency check : helm dep list

Dependency update : helm dep update, it first checks localhost if not found makes api call and pulls tar.


To find tiller server : kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep tiller

> helm home : gives helm installation dir.


% Debugging Helm %:
 - helm lint OR helm template . | kubectl apply -f - [Gives YAmls to debug and find errors.]
